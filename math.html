        <h2>Weighted Importance: <span class="highlight">C > H > D > A > L</span></h2>
        <p>Thus, the Harm Score is calculated as follows:</p>
        <p class="equation">$$ \text{Harm Score} = \min(\max(40C + 30H + 15D + 10A + 5L, 0), 100) $$</p>

        <h3>H: Health Severity</h3>
        <p>Health Severity refers to pre-existing health conditions before starting smoking. This is crucial in the calculation for the harm score of tobacco, as individuals with pre-existing health issues (like cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases) are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of smoking. Smoking can exacerbate these conditions, leading to a more rapid progression of disease and earlier onset of additional complications.</p>

        <h3>D: Duration in Years</h3>
        <p>The inclusion of this variable captures the cumulative effect of tobacco exposure, both first-hand and second-hand. Longer durations of smoking exacerbate health risks and increase the potential for chronic diseases, which is supported by research showing that prolonged exposure to tobacco smoke compounds health risks significantly.</p>

        <h3>A: Age</h3>
        <p>Age at which the individual is assessed is reflective of both the biological impacts of aging and the cumulative effect of smoking over time. Younger individuals who smoke will accrue more damage over time, whereas older individuals are already at increased risk for health issues, which smoking further aggravates.</p>

        <h3>L: Lifestyle</h3>
        <p>Lifestyle factors encompass diet, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and other health behaviors that can interact with smoking. For instance, poor diet and lack of exercise can exacerbate the health risks associated with smoking, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.</p>

        <h3>C: Number of Cigarettes Consumed per Day</h3>
        <p>This variable is a direct measure of exposure to tobacco smoke, with a higher number of cigarettes correlating with increased health risks, including greater risks of developing respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and various types of cancer. The quantity of cigarettes smoked is a critical factor because the severity of many smoking-related diseases is dose-dependent.</p>

        <h3>I: Age of Smoking Initiation</h3>
        <p>Starting to smoke at a younger age can lead to a longer duration of smoking, increasing the cumulative exposure to tobacco and hence the risk of developing severe health issues. This aligns with big data sources from the internet, suggesting that earlier initiation of smoking is associated with greater addiction severity and increased difficulty in quitting.</p>

        <h3>Age of Death: <span class="highlight">A<sub>d</sub></span></h3>
        <p>The age of death is calculated as follows:</p>
        <p class="equation">$$ A_d = A_b - (0.1C + \Delta I + \Delta H + \Delta L) $$</p>

        <h3>Adjustments</h3>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul class="adjustments">
            <li>$$ \Delta I = [0, 5] $$ This value adjusts the age of death based on the age when smoking was initiated, with a range from 0 to 5. Starting to smoke at a younger age typically results in more severe long-term health effects due to longer exposure durations, thus a higher Î”I value signifies a greater reduction in lifespan.</li>
            <li>$$ \Delta H = (0, 10) $$ With a range from 0 to 10, this factor adjusts for the severity of pre-existing health conditions. Individuals with more severe health issues are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of smoking, which can accelerate the progression of their conditions and lead to an earlier mortality.</li>
            <li>$$ \Delta L = (0, 5) $$ Ranging from 0 to 5, this reflects the impact of lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and other health behaviors that can either mitigate or exacerbate the effects of smoking. A healthier lifestyle slows down the onset of smoking-related diseases, whereas a poor lifestyle could accelerate these negative externalities.</li>
