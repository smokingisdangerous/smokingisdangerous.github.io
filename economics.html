        <h2>Economic Impacts of Secondhand Smoking in Shanghai</h2>
        <p>Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) has been linked to various severe health conditions such as respiratory infections or cancer. These health issues result in elevated medical costs for treatments and hospitalizations. A study indicated that the average annual healthcare cost per person exposed to SHS in urban China, including Shanghai, can be estimated at approximately $367.</p>

        <h3>Economic Impact Breakdown</h3>
        <ul class="economic-impact">
            <li><strong>Healthcare Costs:</strong> For a population of 5 million exposed individuals (a conservative estimate), the annual healthcare cost is $367 x 5,000,000 = $1.835 billion.</li>
            <li><strong>Productivity Losses:</strong> Assuming 1 million workers are significantly affected by SHS, the annual productivity loss is $400 x 1,000,000 = $400 million.</li>
            <li><strong>Waste Management Costs:</strong> Street cleaning, public area maintenance, and waste disposal.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Cleanup Expenses:</strong> Water pollution control, especially when cigarette waste blocks the drain.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Image:</strong> Shanghai as a tourist city is impacted by how cigarette waste disturbs the public image of the city.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Case Study: Effective Solution in England</h3>
        <p>An effective case in England shows that the implementation of a cigarette bud voter significantly decreased cigarette waste in a province in London by 65%.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of the Cigarette Bud Voter</h3>
        <ul class="benefits">
            <li><strong>Public Participation:</strong> The public is encouraged to participate and use the vote, reducing the need for extensive government budgets.</li>
            <li><strong>Easy Implementation:</strong> The cigarette bud voter is direct, simple, and easy to implement.</li>
        </ul>
